#Polynomial Regression

This is where the feature variables have a relationship to the dependent variable which is polynomial (though the coefficients of the x terms are still linear, which is why polynomial regression is a subspecies of linear regression).

The data consists of features Position and Level and dependent variable Salary. Levels are numeric and Positions are actually just labels (job-titles) for the levels. So Position is redundant and Level is the only feature needed.

The example illustrates how polynomial linear regression is just like linear regression except that we create derived polynomial features by raising the base features to successively higher powers.

The template files are not part of the polynomial regression exercise. They're just to illustrate the code for polynomial regression as following a pattern, being an instance of a regression exercise.
