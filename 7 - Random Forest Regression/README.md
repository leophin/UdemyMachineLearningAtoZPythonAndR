# Random Forest Regression

The random forest works by building multiple decision trees from random subsets of the data set. The prediction of the random forest is the average of the predictions of its decision trees.

The example again uses the Level, Salary data set and gives a salary prediction for a level of 6.5. The visualisation of the predictions is still blocky (as with decision trees) but there are more blocks. This is because the average moves with the predictions of the underlying trees and there are multiple trees. More trees will result in more blocks and a smoother-looking prediction graphic.
