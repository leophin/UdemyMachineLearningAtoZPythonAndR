# Artificial Neural Networks

The example data set represents customers of a bank. The bank has seen unusually large numbers of customers closing accounts (high churn) and wants to address this. The data is a random sample of customers.

We use the sample dataset to build a model to predict which customers are at risk of leaving the bank.

The neural network model requires intensive processing so we use libraries to parallelise where possible.
