# Eclat Association Rule Learning

This example just gives a way of seeing items most frequently purchased together. Procedure is simplified compared to A Priori and has fewer steps:

1 Set a minimum support.
2 Take all the subsets of transactions that have a support higher than the minimum support.
3 Sort by decreasing support.

So it just gives us a listing.
